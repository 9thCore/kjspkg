## Adding your own package

1. Create a repository containing your scripts and assets
    **Your "assets" folder and your "data" folder should not contain modid sub-directories, everything in them will be saved in assets/<package_name> and data/<package_name>. Please design your scripts with that in mind.**
2. Fork this repo
3. Clone it
4. Add a "<package_name>.json" file to the "pkgs" directory
5. Format it like this:

    ```json
    {
        "repo": "yourname/reponame",

        "author": "<your_name>",
        "description": "Description",
        
        "versions": [<Version key numbers (see the numbers in parentheses in the table below). Can contain multiple numbers>],
        "modloaders": [<Modloaders ("fabric"/"forge", "fabric" will for for quilt as well)>. Can contain multiple modloaders]
    }
    ```

6. Create a pull request

No support means that the version works, but any issues that you have with it won't be fixed.
