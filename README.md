## Adding your own package

1. Create a repository containing your scripts and assets
2. [Don't forget to license your code](https://choosealicense.com/)
3. Add a file to your repo named `.kjspkg` and format it like this:

    ```json
    {
        "author": "<your_name>",
        "description": "<description>",
        
        "versions": [<Version key numbers (see the numbers in parentheses in the table below). Can contain multiple numbers>],
        "modloaders": [<Modloaders ("fabric"/"forge", "fabric" will for quilt as well)>. Can contain multiple modloaders],
        "dependencies": [<Package names that your package depends on, blank if none>],
        "incompatibilities": [<Package names that your package is incompatible with, blank if none>]
    }
    ```

4. Fork this repo
5. Clone it
6. Add your package to `pkgs.json` file. Format it like this: `"your_package_id": "your_github_name/your_repo_name",`
    * You can specify the branch by adding `@branch_name` at the end of the string, otherwise it will automatically use the `main` branch
